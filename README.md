# Invoice-payment-date-prediction
This project is based on machine learning. A machine learning model that predicts the payment date of an invoice.
The purpose of this project is to use machine learning to create a model that will predict a payment date.

The data for this model is fairly simplified as it has 10000 missing payment date. The raw data consists of a training dataset with the features listed above and their corresponding date.
# Methods Used
Data preprocessing of invoices dataset.
feature engineering on the dataset.
Linear Regression
decision tree regression
Random Forest.
